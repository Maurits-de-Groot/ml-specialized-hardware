# AI/ML Resources for Specialized Hardware

Specialized Hardware is a ML (Machine Learning) model accelerator for Inference or Training, like [AWS Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/) and [AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/). In this repo you'll find samples, tutorials and workshops of different applications for Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, etc. that make use of hardware acceleration to reduce model execution latency and increase throughput.
